Tic Tac Toe Game (Tkinter GUI)

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with Python using Tkinter for the GUI. This project demonstrates basic GUI programming, event handling, and game logic implementation.

Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where the goal is to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project is built using Tkinter, Python‚Äôs built-in GUI library.

Features
	‚Ä¢	GUI built with Tkinter.
	‚Ä¢	Two-player turn-based game (Player X vs. Player O).
	‚Ä¢	Displays a message when a player wins or the game ends in a tie.
	‚Ä¢	Automatic board reset after each game.
	‚Ä¢	Simple, clean design using buttons for interaction.

Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	Python (3.7+)
	‚Ä¢	Tkinter (for GUI)
	‚Ä¢	MessageBox (for game notifications)

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Usage

Prerequisites
	‚Ä¢	Python 3.7 or higher
	‚Ä¢	A code editor (e.g., VS Code)

How to Run the Game
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-tkinter.git
cd tic-tac-toe-tkinter


	2.	Run the game:

python main.py

How to Play
	1.	The game starts with Player X.
	2.	Players take turns clicking on the buttons to place their marks.
	3.	The game ends when:
	‚Ä¢	A player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
	‚Ä¢	The board is full (it‚Äôs a tie).
	4.	A message box shows the result, and the game board resets automatically.

Code Explanation

The game is built using an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach:
	‚Ä¢	Class: TicTacToe
	‚Ä¢	Main methods:
	‚Ä¢	__init__() ‚Äì Initializes the game board and buttons.
	‚Ä¢	on_button_click() ‚Äì Handles button clicks and updates the game state.
	‚Ä¢	check_winner() ‚Äì Checks if a player has won.
	‚Ä¢	reset_game() ‚Äì Resets the game board.

Improvements to Consider
	‚Ä¢	Add a single-player mode with an AI opponent.
	‚Ä¢	Customize the GUI with better colors and fonts.
	‚Ä¢	Add a score tracker to keep track of multiple rounds.
